Q => Explain difference between ^1.2.3 and ~1.2.3 in package.json 
with one example. 

A => 
for example i want the versions of a library (PKG "imaginary library name");
if i type PKG:~1.2.3 that means that i have all the vesrions that contain the patch of 3 or above 
means it can be 1.2.3 version or 1.2.4 or any other number bigger than 3 in the patch place

but for ^1.2.3
PKG: ^1.2.3 means that i can have all the versions of 1.2.0 and higher 
it can be 1.2.2 or 1.3.4 it affect the second number which and tells that anything bigger than the 
second number is accepted and any compination of the second and the third number is also accepted
means i can only change the minor and the patch version but the minor has to be bigger of what i have 
right now ,means it has to be bigger than 2 in our example

PKG:~1.2.3 // 1.2.3 , 1.2.4 .1.2.5 
PKG:^1.2.3 //1.2.3, 1.2.4, 1.3.1, 1.3.5
