CSRF tricks a logged-in userâ€™s browser into sending unwanted requests to a site using their cookie-based session.
because the browser automatically includes cookies in the session, the attacker can perform actions as the user without their consent or them knowing.
like changing passwords or making transactions.
One solution in Express is using the csurf middleware, which adds a secret code to forms and verifies it when submitted.
Only requests with the correct code are accepted, which prevent forged cross-site requests.
